I am no longer distributing MyOrgan for reasons of personal conscience.
I will be making a more detailed announcement in the near future.

As MyOrgan was open source, if there truly is interest from the open
source community, then volunteers such as you mention will develop it
under a new name. Better yet, they will start from the beginning and
build an innovative software that is robust and expandable rather than
simply simulating others' ideas. That is my suggestion for you.

I see that you have already started the OurOrgan project on SourceForge.
  MyOrgan remains my trademark presently, and "OurOrgan" is similar to
it and should be avoided. I very strongly recommend against using it as
the name of the new project. In any case the __Organ name has bad
connotations in English, which I found out only after I released the
product. You may not understand it, being French, but you would be
well-advised to select a different name. I think you can rename a
project in the SourceForge control panel.

I see that you've released a binary. The new about screen looks nice
("sourcode" should be "source code"). I would ask that you either please
remove the help file from the binary release, since it contains
references to MyOrgan and Kloria Publishing, or update all references to
MyOrgan with the new name, and particularly change the details on the
technical support page.

P.S. Please also remove the references to the MyOrgan name in each
source code file, and on the about screen. The new project should be a
project in its own right, not to be confused with MyOrgan.

I see that you have made a new release with the help file updated. Thank
you!

I do want to very strongly discourage you not to use the OurOrgan name,
if you wish the project to have any longevity. It would be much easier
to rename the project now before it has many followers. (Think of how
Ethereal had to be renamed WireShark due to trademark issues, etc.) I
will not press the issue any further, but I think you will soon find
that the trademark owner may not be so accomodating.
