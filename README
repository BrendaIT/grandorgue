MyOrgan is a pipe organ sampler.

To compile, currently MinGW must be used.
You will need to get the ASIO SDK and put it in the ASIO/ direcotry.

      (this link could easily change - search for ASIO SDK)
You will need to get and build wxWidgets, in the wxWidgets/ directory.
      http://wxwidgets.org/downloads/      

Code::Blocks was used as the IDE.
A Makefile was exported, but it has not been tested.

To change or add any translations requires gettext.

Help uses CHM-like files and HTML. To make a new HTB, zip up the
contents of the help folder, then change the zip extension to htb.

Changes  31-03-2007 by Johan Blok (Media Center edition)
- some support of VFD (display) while loading samplesets
- loads a different organ driven by MIDI

To compile: 
- directx headers are also required (download Microsoft directX SDK)
- iMON VFD API (http://www.soundgraph.com/aspv1/iMON/download/iMON_VFD_API.zip)

Currect Code::Blocks expects wxWidgets to reside in ./wxWidgets, directx in ./directx, iMON VFD API in ./imon
