<h1>Audio Menu</h1><p>The Audio menu contains commands for dealing with loaded organs and associated settings.</p><hr />
<A NAME="Record"><h2>Record</h2>
<p>Opens a dialog prompting where to save the recorded WAV file. The location will be remembered for the next time, independently of other saved locations. Upon clicking selecting a file name, recording commences and continues until the Record menu option or toolbar button is selected again. A checkmark appears next to the menu item, and the toolbar button remains pushed, to indicate when recording is active.</p>
</A><br /><hr />
<A NAME="Memory"><h2>Memory Set</h2>
<p>Enters memory set mode until the Memory Set menu option or toolbar button is selected again. While the memory set is engaged, whenever you push a divisional or general piston or activate a program change, the organ will store the current settings to that piston or program change rather than recalling them. For example, engaging a divisional piston 1 during memory set will store the state of stops for that manual into piston 1, which could then be pushed later (after memory set has been disengaged) to recall those stops. A checkmark appears next to the menu item, and the toolbar button remains pushed, to indicate when memory set is active.</p>
</A><br /><hr />
<A NAME="Panic"><h2>Panic</h2>
<p>The effect of the panic button is to reset the sound, stopping all sound and turning off all notes. It may also be quickly accessed on the toolbar or via the Escape key. This should be generally unnecessary, although it may be useful if you need to quickly stop the sound output, or if the sound is breaking up due to CPU overload.</p>
</A><br /><hr />
<A NAME="Settings"><h2>Settings</h2>
<p>Displays a tabbed dialog containg the audio settings. For more information, refer to the <A HREF="DeviceSettings.htm">Device Settings</A> and <A HREF="MIDISettings.htm">MIDI Settings</a> sections.</p>
