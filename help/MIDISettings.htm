<A NAME="MIDI"><h2>MIDI Messages</h2>
<p>This screen lists all of the MIDI actions which MyOrgan can respond to. The "Action" column describes the action; the "Event" column shows the MIDI event it is currently tied to; the "Channel" column indicates which channel the action will listen on, if any; the "Data" column indicates the specific data which will trigger the action - for example, a controller number or a program change number. These actions may be modified by selecting the action and clicking "Properties", or by double-clicking on the action.</p>
</A><br /><hr />
<A NAME="Properties"><h2>MIDI Event Properties</h2>
<p>This displays the MIDI event editor dialog. You may select an event from the drop-down box (only available events will be shown), or you may select "(none)" to disable the action. The channel spinner sets the channel tied ot the MIDI message, and the data spinner (when applicable) selects the data tied to the MIDI message. For easy configuration, click "Listen for Event" and then perform the desired MIDI action (i.e. push a note on the appropriate keyboard, do a program change, flip a MIDI switch, etc). If the performed MIDI event is allowed for this action, its data is filled in and the "Listen for Event" button is deactivated. You may also manually deactivate the listener by clicking on it again. Be sure to select OK to save your changes when you're done.</p>
