<h1>History</h1>
<p>Do not uninstall in order to upgrade; this would only remove your settings. Although it is recommended to use the newest available version, previously licensed users are entitled to use any previous version listed below. Installation packages for previous versions are available upon request.</p>

<h2>Concerning the license change</h2>
<p>The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. As is becoming more prevalent in many arenas, Digital Restrictions Management (DRM) are being employed to further constrain your use of sampler software as well as any sample libraries you may have acquired. This is a disturbing trend that creates vendor lock-in and other unapparent consequences, benefiting manufacturers rather than consumers. In contrast, the GNU General Public License now chosen for this product is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software.  It is our hope that this action will bring the sounds of the pipe organ to as many as possible and will promote openness and collaboration in a community that has all too quickly become closed and commercialized. At this time there are no plans to discontinue support or updates for MyOrgan; with community involvement, it is hoped that the project will continue to blossom for many years to come.</p>
