<A NAME="Volume"><h2>Volume Control</h2>
<p>The volume control sets the volume control <u>as a percentage</u> of full volume. Note that this is percentage of voltage, and therefore every half corresponds to -6dB. That is, 50% is -6dB, 25% is -12dB, etc. To the right of the spinner are the left and right audio monitors, respectively. The clip indicator at the far right will turn red if clipping occurs, and will stay red until the volume is adjusted.</p>
</A><br /><hr />
<A NAME="Polyphony"><h2>Polyphony Control</h2>
<p>The polyphony control sets the maximum polyphony before MyOrgan will refuse to play any additional samples. To oversimplify, polyphony is the number of pipes that may sound simultaneously; but polyphony may also be consumed when a key is released. It is recommended to experiment with this setting initially, but leave it once you find an acceptable setting. Your setting should balance between too little polyphony (where you might not be able to play many notes on large sample sets) and too much polyphony (where the CPU will overload and artifacts will appear in the sound). Note that "wet" sample sets (those with considerable reverberation) will consume polyphony many seconds after the note is actually released. The default setting of 1024 should provide a reasonable starting point on a 1GHz CPU. To the right of the spinner is the polyphony monitor. The clip indicator at the far right will turn red if the polyphony limit has been reached, and will stay red until the polyphony is adjusted.</p>

<A NAME="Program"><h2>Program Changes</h2>
<p>The spinner sets the current program number. This might be termed a "sequencer" on modern computerized organs. It is possible to store up to 512 organ states and access them sequentially via the predefined MIDI events, or access any setting directly through the spinner. You may also use the left and right keys on the keyboard to scroll through the programs, and down to reactivate the current program (if you have changed the stops since last activating it, for example). Note also that when memory set is engaged, the target program wil be stored to, i.e. if you push Shift + Right then the program would be advanced and the current settings would be saved to this same next program.</p>
</A><br /><hr />
<A NAME="Manuals"><h2>Manuals</h2>
<p>Each manual as well as the pedalboard is displayed in the center of the screen. The keys are outlined when messages are received, but may not be engaged by clicking the mouse. Right clicking on a manual will open its corresponding MIDI Event Editor.</p>
</A><br /><hr />
<A NAME="Pedals"><h2>Expression Pedals</h2>
<p>Directly above the pedalboard are displayed the pedals, sometimes referred to as "swell pedals", although they may control any of the manuals (Great, Swell, Wonderful, etc). On a pipe organ, swell shutters dampen the sound, and this is simulated in MyOrgan by adjusting the volume of the enclosed pipes. While the mouse is over a pedal, you may use the mouse wheel to adjust its position, or right click to open its corresponding MIDI Event Editor.</p>
</A><br /><hr />
<A NAME="Drawstops"><h2>Drawstops</h2>
<p>The drawstops engage or disengage various components of the organ when clicked - generally new ranks of pipes which are applied to each manual. Other drawstops may perform actions such as coupling one manual to another. This deals with the functionality of pipe organs and is beyond the scope of this documentation. Right clicking on a drawstop will open its corresponding MIDI Event Editor. Any changes made there may be saved in the organ definition file or settings files.</p> 
</A><br /><hr />
<A NAME="Pistons"><h2>Pistons</h2>
<p>Pistons generally perform an action when clicked and do not have an on/off toggle, although some pistons may toggle in this way. Pistons often recall drawstop combinations, and when used in combination with the Memory Set, you can store your own combinations in the pistons. Right clicking on a piston will open its corresponding MIDI Event Editor. Any changes made there may be saved in the organ definition file or settings files.</p>
