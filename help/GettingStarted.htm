<h1>Getting Started</h1><hr />
<A NAME="Introduction"><h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>MyOrgan allows the user to load and play virtual pipe organs. Using sample sets, MyOrgan is able to combine the individual pipe sounds and organ behaviors to simulate a variety of pipe organs.</p></A><br /><hr />

<A NAME="Sample"><h2>Sample Sets</h2>
<p>MyOrgan is capable of loading and faithfully reproducing a variety of sample sets. Through extensive testing, it appears highly compatible with definition files that have worked in Hauptwerk&trade; version 1. Other types of sample sets may also be compatible, and other formats may soon be available. Some sources of compatible sample sets, including freely available ones, are listed on the <A HREF="http://www.kloria.com/myorgan/">MyOrgan home page</A>. As such, you won't be able to do anything at all with MyOrgan without at least one sample set. Sample sets generally come packaged or with installers. By default, the software loads organs from "My Organs" in your documents folder, but you may store sample sets wherever is convenient and space permits.</p></A><br /><hr />
