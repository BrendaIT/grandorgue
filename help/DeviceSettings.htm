<h1>Device Settings</h1><IMG SRC="ourorgan1.gif" BORDER="0" /><hr />
<A NAME="MIDI"><h2>MIDI Input Devices</h2>
<p>A list of all MIDI input interfaces available. Selecting a device means that MyOrgan will listen for incoming MIDI messages on through that interface. This allows to listen to more than one device at a time; for example, to listen to both a controller and a sequencer or loopback device.</p>
</A><br /><hr />
<A NAME="Advanced"><h2>Advanced</h2>
<p>Either select a device and click Advanced, or double click on the device. This brings up a window that allows the setting of a channel offset. A channel offset allows the use of two MIDI interfaces with conflicting MIDI channels. For example, applying a channel offset of 8 to one of the MIDI interfaces would cause that interface's channel 1 to appear as channel 9, channel 2 to appear as channel 10, and so on. This may be useful if you have multiple keyboards that are configured to use the same channel.</p>
</A><br /><hr />
<A NAME="Sound"><h2>Sound Output Device</h2>
<p>Provides a list of available sound output devices. Note that only one device may be used for sound output at a time. Devices are prefixed by their type, e.g. "ASIO", "DirectSound", etc.</p>
<p><b>NOTE:</b> If an ASIO device does not appear, it may be set to an incompatible format. The control panel for the ASIO device must be set to 44.1kHz 16-bit sound.</p>
</A><br /><hr />
<A NAME="Estimated"><h2>Estimated Latency</h2>
<p>This allows you to set a <u>requested</u> latency, and after you click OK or Apply, the sound system will determine tne closest feasible latency and change the value to this <u>estimated</u> latency. Note that the estimate is based on numbers provided by the hardware and may vary. <b>Many ASIO devices do not allow you to change their latency except in their control panel when the device is not in use.</b> Refer to your sound card documentation for more information. Note that use of third party drivers, such as ASIO4All, may function properly but is not supported.</p>
</A><br /><hr />
<A NAME="Load"><h2>Load Stereo Samples</h2>
<p>If set to Mono, all samples are loaded in Mono. When compression is disabled, this will save 50%, but when compression is enabled, much less will be saved because the compression is much less effective on monoaural inputs.</p><table>
<tr><th><b>Memory</b></th><td>Variable savings up to 50%</td></tr>
<tr><th><b>Polyphony</b></th><td>No impact</td></tr>
<tr><th><b>Load time</b></th><td>No impact</td></tr>
</table></A><br /><hr />
<A NAME="Lossless"><h2>Lossless Compression</h2>
<p>Uses a lossless algorithm (i.e. the original samples can be perfectly reconstructed) so that RAM requirements are lessened. Particularly useful for large sample sets.</p><table>
<tr><th><b>Memory</b></th><td>Variable savings up to 40%</td></tr>
<tr><th><b>Polyphony</b></th><td>Approx. 10% lower</td></tr>
<tr><th><b>Load time</b></th><td>Approx. 20% slower</td></tr>
</table></A><br /><hr />
<A NAME="Active"><h2>Active Polyphony Management</h2>
<p>When polyphony reaches 3/4 of the current maximum value, release samples (reverberation tails) are faded out in order to conserve polyphony.</p><table>
<tr><th><b>Memory</b></th><td>No impact</td></tr>
<tr><th><b>Polyphony</b></th><td>Conserved</td></tr>
<tr><th><b>Load time</b></th><td>No impact</td></tr>
</table></A><br /><hr />
<A NAME="Phase"><h2>Release Sample Phase Alignment</h2>
<p>When a note is released, phase cancellation may occur as the release sample cross fades in. Selecting this option will make a best effort to phase align the release sample to help minimize this effect.</p><table>
<tr><th><b>Memory</b></th><td>No impact</td></tr>
<tr><th><b>Polyphony</b></th><td>No impact</td></tr>
<tr><th><b>Load time</b></th><td>No impact</td></tr>
</table></A><br /><hr />
<A NAME="Detachment"><h2>Release Sample Detachment</h2>
<p>When a note is released, the tremulants or swell pedals would not normally affect the reverberation, and therefore it is highly recommended to leave this option engaged.</p><table>
<tr><th><b>Memory</b></th><td>No impact</td></tr>
<tr><th><b>Polyphony</b></th><td>Slight impact</td></tr>
<tr><th><b>Load time</b></th><td>No impact</td></tr>
</table></A><br /><hr />
<A NAME="Scaling"><h2>Release Sample Scaling</h2>
<p>For those sample sets with long reverberation tails ("wet"), enabling this option will fade out the release sample if the note is played staccato. It will have little to no effect on "dry" sample sets.</p><table>
<tr><th><b>Memory</b></th><td>No impact</td></tr>
<tr><th><b>Polyphony</b></th><td>Slight impact</td></tr>
<tr><th><b>Load time</b></th><td>No impact</td></tr>
</table></A><br /><hr />
<A NAME="Randomize"><h2>Randomize Pipe Speaking</h2>
<p>This will apply a very small (less than 1ms) random delay before each pipe begins to speak. This may help combinations of stops to sound more natural and less repetitive.</p><table>
<tr><th><b>Memory</b></th><td>No impact</td></tr>
<tr><th><b>Polyphony</b></th><td>No impact</td></tr>
<tr><th><b>Load time</b></th><td>No impact</td></tr>
</table></A><br /><hr />
